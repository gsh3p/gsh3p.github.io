Welcome to our Blog. We are a couple currently traveling around Canada. We spent the first part of our time in Canada living in Toronto, ON. We have now moved to Vancouver, BC to explore the West Coast. The main reason for the blog is to share our adventures and give us a journal to look back on someday.
