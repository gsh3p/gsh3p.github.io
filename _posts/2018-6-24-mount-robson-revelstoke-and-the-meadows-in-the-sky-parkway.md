After Jasper, the next stop on our list was Revelstoke. To get there, we decided to take the less direct route and continue north west towards Mt Robson Provincial park. We planned a brief stop off in Clearwater to break up the 600km drive.

Seeing Mount Robson had been high on our list, as it is the highest peak in the Canadian rockies. We were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of it when hiking up Whistlers Summit in Jasper.

When we arrived at the visitor centre we were both taken back by the size of Mt Robson. However, it wasn't until we drove a little further down the road that you really see the size of it. It's HUUGE!!!

## Clearwater

After a day of driving we stopped off in Clearwater for the night. The campsite was pretty much in the middle of a forrest. A late arrival resulted in setting up in the dark and getting mauled by mosquitos in the process. It was probably the quickest setup we've done so far!

The next morning we were headed for Revelstoke. After a quick pit stop in Kamloops to switch out the rental car, we were back in business.

## Revelstoke

Revelstoke was a surprise gem on the trip. It was a nice little mountain town, and was somewhat less touristy than Banff and Jasper.

Our campsite was a nice spot and was situated on Williamson Lake.

We mainly explored the local shops and enjoyed some good coffee. We also drove the Meadows in the Sky Parkway.

This takes you up Mount Revelstoke and is one of the few places you can actually reach the summit of a mountain via a paved road.

However, due to the time of year, we could only drive partway up as there was still snow near the top. There's only a small window where the road is clear enough to get all the way to the top. We managed to drive 21kms of the total 26kms. High enough to get amazing views and we were lucky enough to see another two black bears wandering along the road.
