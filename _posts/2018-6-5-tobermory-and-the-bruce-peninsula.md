<p class="article-intro">Tobermory is a small harbour town located about 4 hours north of Toronto, situated on the Bruce Peninsula. One side is surrounded by the Great Lake Huron, the other by Georgian Bay.</p>

It is on the Fathom Five National Marine Park and the Bruce Peninsula National Park, which also features the Bruce trail. A famous trail in Ontario, which extends all the way down to Niagara. We had previously hiked along parts of this when we were living in Barrie.

## Cyprus Lake

To start the day we took a short drive to Cyprus Lake. We opted to take the Horse Lake trail to the Grotto, as the lady at the park entrance had advised that the other trails were still wet and muddy due to snow.

There were a couple of obstacles at the start, but we soon found our stride and wandered alongside Horse Lake. It was nice to be back hiking again, a well received break from the hustle and bustle of Toronto.

We soon reached an opening, and made our way along a rocky beach to reach Indian Head Cove. The views were great, crystal clear water with different shades of blue and turquoise.

On our way up to the Grotto, we were fortunate that we ran into a Czech guy, who told us about a secret entrance to access the Grotto.

The entrance was tucked away and looked a little tight. We weren’t sure how steep it was to get down, but he assured us that earlier, a 12 year old kid had made it safely down.

That was enough encouragement to want to get down there and take a closer look.

Once descending through the small gap, there was still some snow and ice. I was able to carefully shimmy down the rocks to make it to the bottom.

It was nice and quiet down there, with only the sounds of dripping water in the Grotto.

After climbing back up, we continued along the trail. Reaching another opening, we were greeted with a beautiful bay overlooking Lake Huron.

We wandered along the rocky beach, taking in the views whilst trying to watch our footing as we went.

After making the short ascent up to the Overhang, we were rewarded with more beautiful views of the bay. The bluffs, trees and crystal clear water along the shoreline really are something special.

We perched here on the rocks to enjoy lunch and take in the views some more.

As time was getting on and we were booked in for a boat tour in the arvo, we began our hike back towards the car. Instead of going the way we came from, we headed back along the Marr Lake trail to complete a full loop.

## The Shipwrecks and Flowerpot Island

After a morning of hiking we headed back to the town of Tobermory to dock 4. It was time to board the speed boat to head over to Flowerpot Island.

At the beginning we slowly cruised out of the bay and headed towards our first stop - two historic shipwrecks.

The water was so clear. The skipper stopped the boat, and carefully rotated us around to remove the ripple that had been caused from our approach.

We held in place for a little while, a great chance for photos. The water seemed pretty deep even though we were so close to shore.

I was curious as we were literally right above the wreck. The guy said that the distance from the top of the wreck to the hull of our boat was approximately 15 feet.

The wrecks both seemed to be in really good condition, considering they were a few centuries old and dated back to the 1800's.

After the wrecks the tour continued and we headed towards the island. As we approached we could soon see the rock formations, towers, flowerpot like.

We were dropped at the jetty and told to be back in time for our scheduled departure time. Ours was the last one of the day at 5:30pm. We certainly weren’t going to miss it!

We spent the next couple of hours wandering around the island. We got some photos of the flowerpots, ate some snacks and had a brief run in with some huge seagulls (Nature 1. Guy 0). We then went on to complete both the lighthouse and mountain trails before returning to the dock for the boat back to Tobermory.

## Lookout tower at the Visitor Centre

When we arrived back to Tobermory we had just enough time to go to the visitor centre and head up the lookout tower which has great views of little dunks bay.

Coming to Tobermory in tail end of winter / start of spring is ideal. It’s essentially off peak, so not super busy. We hit on lucky in that we had two sunny days, and the hiking conditions were ideal.

The only downside was that a few places around town were not open yet for the summer season. However, for us this wasn’t an issue.
