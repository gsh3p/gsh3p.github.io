<p class="article-intro">We were lucky enough share this trip with some good friends. Who are not only great fun but also super organised and pretty much organised most of this trip (Thank you!!).</p>

We stayed in a cottage in Dorset which was 40 minutes outside of Algonquin Provincial Park. The cottage itself was like a dream. A wooden cabin, fire pit, a jetty...all over looking Lake Kawagama. We spent our afternoon kayaking and canoeing on the lake (the boys managed to sneak a beer on their kayaks) and a night drinking beers/wine around a fire pit.

Our first day we quickly ate breakie and headed to Algonquin Provincial Park. We first stopped off in the park centre to see where the latest moose, bears, loons and other animals were spotted. We then drove along highway 60, eyes peeled for animals.

We completed the Track and Tower Trail (approx 7.7KMs), this trail was great fun. There was some icy parts but we managed to find a quaint spot to have lunch and share some tea (English Breakfast of course).

After this hike we went to the lookout point at the visitor centre, which overlooked the Algonquin Provincial Park. After the visitor centre we headed to another trail, the Beaver Trail. This was a short 3km hike which went around two lakes and passed beaver dams.

At this time, we conceded we were not going to see any animals outside the woodpeckers, squirrels and chipmunks...or so we thought... As we were driving along highway 60 to exit the park we noticed a lot of cars pulled over (a lot of cars = something interesting). We parked along with the other cars and as we exited our car we saw what everyone else saw. A MOOSE! A male bull moose, with his antlers slowly growing back.

After a day of trails and just being in nature we headed back to the cottage. We settled in for the final night and enjoyed some well deserved beers and snags around the fire.
