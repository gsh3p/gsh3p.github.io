<p class="article-intro">After a day of hiking at tent ridge, we said our farewells to Sarah and Robbie and made the short drive to Banff. Our accommodation for the next few days would be Tunnel Mountain Village campsite, situated right in the heart of Banff National Park, Alberta.</p>

After a slightly better nights sleep, we spent our first full day mainly wandering around Banff town. It was a nice, small mountain town nestled in amongst a few a peaks.

Even though I expected it, I was still pleasantly surprised at the amount of tourists in Banff. Mainly buses of Chinese tourists, a lot of English, and pretty much every worker we met in the local restaurants were Australian.

## Moose Meadows, Ink Pots and Johnston Canyon Falls

After having a leisurely first day we were both eager to get back out and do some hiking. For our first hike in the area we decided to head to the near by Bow Valley Parkway and visit Johnston Canyon.

We had read that this was a very popular day hike, suitable for families and people of almost any age and fitness level. As a result it can often get quite crowded. With that in mind, we took the alternative hike via Moose Meadows which bypasses this trail.

We were a little hesitant at the start of the hike, as after the first 50 metres of the trail we came across a nice pile of bear scat. Fortunately there was a couple that came along just behind us, so we continued the beginning part of the trail with them.

This trail eventually meets with the Johnston Canyon trail, and we continued on a few more kms after that to reach Ink Pots. The Ink Pots were cool, situated in a meadow surrounded by mountains and the river. There were several greenish pools, made up of mineral springs. Upon looking closely you could see them bubbling.

After having lunch at the Ink Pots we made our way back. We had plenty of time so stoppped off at both the Johnston Canyon Upper and Lower falls to take some photos.

## Tunnel Mountain

The following morning was a slower one. Despite feeling a little sore we decided that we would hike up Tunnel Mountain. It was only down the road from our campsite, and it is a fairly short hike. It did have a few steep sections but we were able to make the top. The views from the top were certainly worth it.

After spending more time in Banff we were driving back to the campsite when we came across some cars pulled over. We instantly thought wildlife! As we pulled closer we were lucky enough to see several Elk at the side of the road, including a small calf.  More wildlife to add to our list, and a new personal favourite of mine.
