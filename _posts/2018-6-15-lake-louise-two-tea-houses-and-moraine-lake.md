We woke up a little sore from the previous day's, as well as an uncomfortable night sleeping in the car. The last few nights had been fairly cold and close to zero, so we had took a break from the tent and tried sleeping in the car. Safe to say it wasn't great.

After a quick breakfast, we jumped in the car and made the short drive to Lake Louise. Upon arrival, we parked up along with the many other tourists and buses of tourists.

We took a few photos by the lake with the crowds then set off on the 3.4km hike up to the tea house at Lake Agnus. It was pretty steep on the way up for most of the way and I really struggled to get going. We had a brief stop at Mirror Lake, before going up the final 800m incline to reach Lake Agnus, which is situated at  7,005 feet.

There are a few options when reaching the top, snack and head back down, or head to either Little or Big Bee Hive. We went with the latter, and decided to tackle Big Bee Hive.

After heading around the lake, we hit a lot of snow. We had to carefully make our way across to get to the beginning of the switchbacks. Going up there were a few sketchy parts, snowy, narrow and it was very steep. One slip, or wrong foot and it was a long way down to an icey cold lake!

About half way up we contemplated going back, but after speaking with a few passers by, we decided that the worst was over. Plus it would have been difficult to get back down at that stage.

The views from the top were amazing, and definitely worth the challenge for getting up there. Lake Louise was so much better from here!

We headed back down the other side, which was a much easier and clearer path. It was all trail and very little snow. By now we were on a roll, we ended up following the high line trail which connected us with the plain of six glacier trail. At that point we decided to go all out and head for the second tea house on the glacier trail.

We actually made it all the way to the second tea house, which was nestled amongst glaciers. It was amazing. It was pretty cool as it was also helicopter day. One of only two days of the year when they helicopter supplies up to the tea house. For all other days during the season, workers hike up with the supplies.

All up it was a massively rewarding day, we managed to rack up 16km and got to experience some pretty spectacular views. We stopped off at Moraine Lake on the way back and demolished some well deserved burgers in Banff.
