title: Driving the Icefields Parkway
categories: Travel

We woke up early partly due to the rain, but also as we were checking out of our site and had a day of driving ahead. The Icefields Parkway, a 232km stretch of road linking Lake Louise with Jasper, Alberta. Rated as one of the top drives in the world, understandably one of the most anticipated parts of the trip for me.

There is lots to see and do on this stretch of road, so when planning the trip we allowed two days and would spend a night camping on the parkway. After briefly stopping in Lake Louise for fuel and a much needed coffee we were all set.

Our first stop along the parkway was Lake Hector and Bow Lake, both were spectacular but there was something about Bow Lake and it's surrounding mountains that I really liked.

We then continued to our next stopping point which was the amazing turquoise Peyto Lake. It did not disappoint and was like something from a postcard. Apparently it gets it's colour from the surrounding glacier rock's flour that flows into it during the summer months.

We then continued driving, stopping off at some more lookout points, before arriving at Saskatchewan Crossing for a late lunch.

## Camping at Wilcox Creek Campground

We had shortlisted a few options for campgrounds to stay over for the night. Just as well because two of the options which we drove past were actually closed. I think this was due to snow and the weather. We spent the night at Wilcox Creek Campground.

Unfortunately our tent was fairly wet from the pack down in Banff that morning so we ended up sleeping in the car for the night. The temperature got down to zero and there was even a light snow shower.

Turns out the site is located just down the road from the Sunwapta Pass which is the second highest point of the parkway at 6,677ft above sea level. There is something special about being completely off the grid, in the middle of the mountains.

## Wilcox Pass and back on the road again

The next morning we were able to get in a hike and do the Wilcox Pass trail. Fortunately it wasn't too steep, but our high altitude starting point certainly added to the difficulty. It took us a few hours and we were rewarded with amazing views of the peaks and glaciers on the eastern edge of the Columbia Icefields.

There's also the Athabasca Glacier (the largest glacier in Canada)... at 6kms long, it covers an area of 6 km2 and is measured to be between 300â€“980 ft thick!

We continued driving towards Jasper and made stop offs to see the Weeping Wall, Sunwapta Falls, and finally the Athabasca falls. Another day of amazing scenery and no matter how many photographs I took, I still couldn't capture the beauty of it all. We were even lucky enough to see some more rockies wildlife in the form of mountain goats and our first black bear.

Icefields Parkway certainly did not disappoint and I can conclude that it is the best stretch of road I've ever driven.
