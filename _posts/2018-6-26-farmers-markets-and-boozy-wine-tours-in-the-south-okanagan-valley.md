We spent the next 5 days of our trip in the Okanagan Valley. A famous region in British Columbia known for it's wineries and fruit orchards. We stayed just south of Kelowna at the Okanagan Lake Provincial Park South.

The drive here from Revelstoke was spectacular.

Okanagan Valley is separated into 7 sub-regions. All of which, have their own speciality. You have the Kelowna Lake Country (beer, beer, beer), Peachland/Summerland, Naramata/Penticton (boutique wineries), Okanagan Falls, Oliver, Golden Mile Bench and Osoyoos (delicious red wine). The architecture alone of some of these wineries set against the back drop of vineyards is enough for a visit in itself, even if you do not drink alcohol (but we do, so win, win).

On our first day or so we explored the region by car. We were surprised how desert like the area was, and how some wineries were almost built on a cliff or within a cliff. Our first meal in this area was delicious and fairly reasonably priced for the area (look up Wild Goose Vineyards - the wine tastings were reasonably priced too).

We were lucky enough to be in this area during the weekend. It was highly recommended by many locals to visit the Penticton Farmers Market. This market is huge!

The best thing is everything is local to BC, this includes the fruits and veggies, cheese, art work, crafts, oils, alcohol (of course) and more. The only thing that was not really local was the Starbucks - of which many travelers know is usually the travel bathroom, the wi-fi hot spot and where unique spelling of names occur (Guy without an "i" somehow turned into igui).

There were people who were dedicated to growing mushrooms (the non-hallucinogenic kind), to people obsessed with baking perfect scones. We also bought coffee from a VW van where they used mugs brought from home. After you were finished drinking your coffee, you would drop the mugs in buckets all over the farmers market to be cleaned and re-used for the next coffee drinker.

The day after, we went for our wine tour so we could both drink. After making a few phone calls we signed up with Experienced Wine Tours for the South Okanagan Tour. It was one of the more expensive tour options, but the only option available for that day.  

On the plus side it was one of the only wine tours that supplied lunch and it was delicious, all local produce again. The tour guide was also very knowledgable and you could tell, he loved his wines. If we were to do this again we would sign up for the Naramatta Bench Tour (Naramatta and Golden Mile Bench). Despite this, it was a fun day and we were both pretty merry in the end.
