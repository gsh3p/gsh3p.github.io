title: Hitting the road and our first hike at Tent Ridge Horseshoe

<p class="article-intro">After a few days in Calgary and stocking up on camping gear we were all set to hit the road. Our first stop was Bow Valley Campground, just outside of the small mountain town Canmore.</p>

After a fairly sleepless first night our friends Robbie and Sarah met us at our site the following morning for a day of hiking.

We were both pretty excited to get out exploring and to do our first hike in the Rockies. The hike for the day was Tent Ridge Horseshoe.

The trail was situated just outside of Canmore in the Peter Lougheed Provincial Park. We parked up at the Nordic centre, then all jumped in Robbie's truck to drive up to the trail. The big Tundra was definitely more suitable than our Ford Escape rental car for the roads which took us up there.

Rocky, windy mountainous roads, the type not great for a cars paintjob. On the way up we seen a group of mountain sheep in the middle of the road, our first glimpse of rockies wildlife.

At the trail head we had a brief chat with some other hikers who were also getting ready to head out. As it was early season, we were advised that there was still a lot of snow around - one of them had a joke with me as I was wearing shorts.

The first part of the trail was mainly through the bush. I felt a little nervous initially as I'd heard a few horror stories of bear encounters. Luckily we were all armed with our bear spray and we were in a group which is always advisable. Our friends were experienced so that certainly helped put me at ease too.

As we got going I settled in and it felt great to just be out in the middle of the mountains taking in the fresh air. After a few KM's we came out through the forest and were up in a basin area. There was a lot of snow around and definitely signs of an avalanche. We also got a great view of the ridge which we would be climbing up.

To get up to the start of the ridge was a little tricky. The heavy snow had covered parts of the trail so we kind of winged it through trees and hit a few patches of knee deep snow. A little cold on the legs but it was all good in the end. By this point we had also had the four seasons, but the rain had eased off a bit and the sun was trying to come out.

We scrambled up the beginning of the ridge and got to a nice spot to stop for lunch. The views were amazing!!! Panoramic views of the valley below, the horseshoe ridge, surrounding peaks and Spray Lake were incredible. I took multiple photos with my phone but it just isn't possible to capture the beauty and vastness of the landscape.

At that point I could already feel that this hiking in the mountains business was going to become addictive. The rest of the ridge looked fairly advanced, so Priscilla and myself conceded that it would have been too difficult for us to tackle. We all agreed to head back the way we came.

When we reached the car we'd clocked up around 7.2km and an elevation gain of 416m. Although we didn't reach the highest point of the ridge, we certainly got to a decent height.

To celebrate our first hike and the group's hard work we stopped off for a well deserved beer at the Canmore Brewing Company.
