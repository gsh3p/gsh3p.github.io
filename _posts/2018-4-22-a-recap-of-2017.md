title: A recap of 2017
categories: Travel

<p class="article-intro">Hello everyone, Guy and I have realised that we have been a little non-existent on the blog front, so this will be a quick recap of 2017 (mainly with pretty pictures and some bits of advice if you plan to visit any of these places).</p>

Right now Guy and I are mainly working to fund our next trip. We’ve just come back from Boston – Guy’s belated birthday present. (Post coming soon).

We did have a humorous start when first entering Canada, in Toronto. Guy was grilled on IT /web stuff at customs, we originally thought that customs were really protecting Canadian borders, only to find out that this particular man was trying to get a start up on his side business. After entering we were lucky enough to be picked up from our friends, who provided us home (in Barrie, Ontario) until we could figure out what we were doing (because we seriously did not have a clue).

Our trip patterns ended up being Barrie > Ottawa > Montreal > Barrie > Niagara > Barrie > Toronto > Barrie > Toronto.

<h2>Ottawa</h2>

We hired a car to travel to Ottawa/Montreal, but you can also get cheaper transport via Megabus. We looked at getting the train however, it was going to be expensive so we decided to go with a hire car instead. This would give us full freedom on our travel and allowed us to visit Montreal, which was not part of our original plan.

Oh the prettiness of Ottawa! We really enjoyed eating and sightseeing here. I also heard that this is the place to be to celebrate Canada Day. This is some of the stuff we did/seen:

<ul>
<li>Hired a bike – Easiest way to see everything all at once.</li>
<li>Landsdowne Park – Danced the day away at Escapade Festival.</li>
<li>Rideau Canal – You can also ice skate on the canal in winter.</li>
<li>Rideau Fall.</li>
<li>Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica.</li>
<li>Byward Markets.</li>
<li>Parliament Hill, Supreme Courts and library archives – Currently closed for construction (and I’ve been told it may be closed for the next 10 years).</li>
<li>Chateau Laurier.</li>
<li>Prime Minister’s Residence.</li>
<li>Canadian Museum of Nature – Pretty impressive. (If you are on a budget or just like to be a bit penny-savvy, there are days/evenings where you can explore the museum for free / at a reduced rate.)</li>
<li>The Mint –  I like to learn, so geeking out pretty hard here.</li>
<li>Eglin Street – Eat your way through this street!</li>
<li>Glebe street – More food…</li>
</ul>

Just a little tip, that is probably not a tip. Do your research for accommodation options. For the first few days Guy and I stayed in the worst accommodation ever. The hygiene was non-existent. It smelt like cheese, there was blood on the wall and no cover on the quilt. We made up some excuse to leave. I swear, if we stayed any longer Guy would have become pregnant from the sheets alone. Do your research. Period.

<h2>Montreal</h2>

We stayed here for 3 nights/2 days. You definitely need more time, we did not see everything we wanted, but we also did not plan to go to Montreal until we found out it was only a 2 hour drive away. If you want great poutine, smoked sandwiches and amazing coffee (real coffee, not watery/instant coffee) this is the place to be.

This is what we did, during the limited time we had:

<ul>
<li>Mount Royal.</li>
<li>Pointe-a-Calliere Museum – Almost the entire museum is underground, it showcases remnants of old Montreal.</li>
<li>Rue St Paul – food, food, food.</li>
<li>Rue St Denis – Food, food, food.</li>
<li>Old Montreal – Cobble streets and a piece of Europe in North America.</li>
<li>Old Port Montreal.</li>
<li>Places d’armes.</li>
<li>Places Jacques Cartier.</li>
<li>Notre Dame Basilica.</li>
<li>Universite du Quebec.</li>
<li>Jazz Festival – Free! Lots and lots of fun, music is all around.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Niagara / Niagara on the Lake</h2>

For those who want to go to Niagara, do it! Just have some realistic expectations before you go. On one side you have this beautiful natural wonder and then you turn around to the main town and suddenly, you get hit with a lot of fake and cheesy.

If you want to save money, I would say stay a little out of Niagara town, unless you pick an amazing deal on Scoopon. Also be aware of the Tourist Tax, it can be up to an extra 10 percent on top of the normal tax. If you do not want to stay, take a bus from Toronto. Do a day trip.

What is Niagara-On-The-Lake? It is separate from Niagara town but it is within the region, about a 20 min drive from Niagara town (there is also a bus available). It is a cute little town and it is all about vineyards, wine, beer and cheese. If you can hire a tour company to take you around, you will be able to sample this cute little town properly.

So here are the things we did in this region:

<ul>
<li>Maid of the Mist – Straight into the actual waterfall itself. Lots of fun. If you get a voucher from a friend, check if it’s the US side or the Canadian side. I’ve been told the Canadian side is better, but a Canadian told me that so there might be some bias.</li>
<li>White Water Walk.</li>
<li>Niagara-On-The-Lake breweries and wineries:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Konzelmann – you can see Toronto from here on a clear day.</li>
    <li>Trius.</li>
    <li>Peller Estates.</li>
    <li>Inniskillin.</li>
    <li>Silversmith Brewery Company – this company converted a Church into the brewery. Amen!</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Toronto</h2>

This is where we have been living. We sort of just accidentally ended up here, but it has been lots of fun. There is always something happening, especially in the summer. Here is some stuff we have done/seen:

<ul>
<li>CN tower – Guy loves this tower. To the point where he asked his own girlfriend to step aside so he could take the millionth photo of “her”. She is also the compass of Toronto. If you get lost just follow her to find your way back.</li>
<li>Distillery district – cobble stones, shops, coffee and beer.</li>
<li>St Lawrence Markets – Food, food, food. Pea meal (bacon) sandwiches, and some great seafood. There is a place way at the back that has great servings and is pretty reasonably priced.</li>
<li>Eaton Centre – shopping.</li>
<li>Rogers Centre – Baseball! Watch the Blue Jays and eat a hot dog.</li>
<li>BMO Field – Watch College Football League and eat a hot dog.</li>
<li>Air Canada Centre – Basketball! Watch the Raptors and eat a hot dog.</li>
<li>Toronto sign/Nathan Phillip Square – Mandatory, and if you come in winter you can also ice skate in front of the sign and take a selfie.</li>
<li>China town – Dumplings!</li>
<li>Little Italy – food.</li>
<li>Little Portugal – food.</li>
<li>Kensington markets – food.</li>
<li>Scarborough Bluffs – Not directly in the city, but these cliffs are very pretty.</li>
<li>Hamilton/Dundas village – Between Toronto and Niagara. It is a very cute town and there are a lot of waterfalls in this region. We were able to view Dundas Peak, Webster and Tews falls. There are plenty more, if you enjoy hiking like we do.</li>
</ul>

We have done a lot more but I cannot remember at this point. There is plenty of eating choices in Toronto if you like to eat.

Anyone who likes hiking can find beautiful scenery along the Bruce’s Trail. This trail goes from Niagara all the way to Tobermory. We were able to explore parts of it while in Barrie and got to visit the beautiful Hogs Falls and Eugenia falls.

Thank you for reading. I hope you had fun.

Speak soon,
Guy and Priscilla xxx
