The final stop for our road trip was Whistler. Also known as “Whistralia”, it didn’t take us long to realise where the nickname came from. Pretty much all of the staff in the local shops, restaurants and pubs were aussies. We even met someone from Perth, which was the first time for the trip.  

Our home for the next 5 days was the Whistler RV and Campground, conveniently located a short drive from the main village. Upon arrival, we were told that there had been recent bear sightings at the site. This was becoming the norm... fortunately we didn’t get any late night visitors to our tent.

Most of our time in Whistler was spent around the village, we also watched the final England group game at one of the local pubs.

### Hiking Joffre lakes

After a recommendation from a lady in Jasper, we were told to check out the Joffre Lakes hike.

It was about an hour north of our campsite just past Pemberton. The hike was fairly steep, but we managed to smash it out in just under 3 hours.

It basically takes you up to 3 different lakes, a lower, middle and then upper lake which is surrounded by snow capped mountains and a huge glacier. Pretty awesome! It’s one of the more popular ones in the area though, so get there early to find a parking spot and beat the crowds.

### Brandywine Falls

Just down the road from our site was the Brandywine Falls. A short walk from car park you get to see the 70m waterfalls.

As we wrapped up our time in Whistler, we headed south to Vancouver. The Sea to Sky Highway (Highway 99) was a great drive.

Unfortunately, it was pretty overcast, and the thick clouds blocked some of the views. But knowing how close it was to Vancouver, we knew we would have the opportunity to drive it again.
