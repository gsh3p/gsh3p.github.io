<p class="article-intro">Having time to process the last couple of days of our move to Canada we realised that we may have been a tad bit disorganised and chaotic.</p>

Looking back we probably should have started packing our house 3 weeks before we left to move to our friends, it may have been a good idea for the both of us to only have a suitcase by that point, and for a certain Ford Festiva vehicle to have already been sold…

Every procrastinator and poor time managers will understand that ridiculous panic of “holy moly I should have done everything yesterday” – which has pretty much been our motto with the whole moving experience and up until the point we checked in.

It was nice to finally get checked in with our bags, probably the most relaxed we’d both felt all day. Keeping in tradition to every airport visit was the first stop to the pub, to enjoy a final pint of little creatures pale ale.

Throughout this move we have only confirmed that we have amazing friends and family – who undeniably have ensured we made it on the plane… so sorry for the dregs of stuff we left on the way out…

Oh well, here goes to a new adventure…
