Our time in Jasper was initially a little disrupted due to a few issues with the rental car. After several phone calls and some woeful customer service, we were sorted and scheduled to pick up a replacement vehicle in Kamloops in a few days time.

The weather was amazing (in the 30’s) so we were keen to get out and about. For our first day we took the gondola up to Whistlers mountain.

## Whistlers Mountain

On the way up we were informed that the brown pine trees we could see, had in fact been infected with mountain pine beetle. Unfortunately a huge amount of the pine trees in Jasper National park have been affected by this (nearly half) and will turn brown, then red and eventually die.

The views from the top were stunning, overlooking Jasper town, the surrounding lakes and mountains. We could even see the peak of Mount Robson (the highest mountain in the Canadian Rockies), which was over 100kms away! Apparently it is only clear enough to see it for about two months of the year.

At the top of Whistlers mountain we took the short hike up to the summit. Although not too challenging, the views from here at 2470m above sea level were even better than those from the gondola station.

Indian ridge looked amazing and has been added to a growing list of “to do” hikes / goals. Safe to say we’ve certainly caught the hiking bug.

On the way back down to the car park we got talking to a couple who recommended driving along Maligne Lake road as it was a hot spot for wildlife, especially bears.

## Maligne Canyon and Maligne Lake

The following day we took a look around Jasper town and most importantly stopped off at the pub to watch the England game.

In the afternoon we headed to Maligne Canyon. We did the short bridges hike here that follows along the canyon. It was great and interesting to see.

To conclude the day we took up the recommendation to drive along Maligne Lake road in search of wildlife. It certainly didn't disappoint. The drive was a quiet stretch of road and at one point we were driving around a huge lake that seemed to just keep going.

We were lucky enough to see some black bears on the way and at one point I had to stop as there was a mother and two cubs wandering along the road. It was amazing to see.

On the drive back we seen more bears (11 in total!) and even seen a bald eagle in a tree next to a river. It was really amazing to see these animals in their natural habitat.

On that note, I’ll leave this post with a few of the photos we managed to snap.
